## 🔍 Summary

This project uses environmental and soil data (N, P, K, pH, rainfall, temperature, humidity) to train two classification models — a multinomial logistic regression and a random forest — to recommend the most appropriate crop.

The random forest model achieved a predictive accuracy of over 99%.
